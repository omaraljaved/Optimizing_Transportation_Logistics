The retailer seeks to minimize transportation costs while meeting customer demand for multiple product types. The optimization model helps the retailer make strategic decisions regarding the distribution of goods from warehouses to customers, considering capacity constraints and delivery time requirements.

# Problem Description:
The retailer has several warehouses (Warehouse1, Warehouse2, Warehouse3) and serves a diverse set of customers (CustomerA, CustomerB, CustomerC, CustomerD) located in different regions. The retailer offers multiple product types (ProductX, ProductY, ProductZ) with varying demand at each customer location. The primary goal is to optimize the shipment of products from warehouses to customers while minimizing transportation costs.

# Model Components:
**Transportation Cost:** The model incorporates transportation costs between each warehouse and customer pair. The cost values are provided as inputs and reflect the expenses associated with shipping one unit of product from a specific warehouse to a customer.

**Demand and Capacity:** The model considers the demand for each product type at each customer location. Additionally, it accounts for capacity constraints at each warehouse, which define the maximum amount of each product that can be shipped from the warehouse.

**Delivery Time Constraint:** To ensure timely deliveries, the model includes a constraint that requires the total shipment from all warehouses to each customer for a specific product to meet or exceed the customer's demand. This ensures that customers receive their products on time.

# Objective Function:
The primary objective is to minimize the total transportation costs incurred while delivering products to all customers. The model aims to find the most cost-effective shipping plan that satisfies customer demand and capacity constraints.

# Constraints:
**Capacity Constraint:** The total shipment of each product type from a warehouse to all customers should not exceed the warehouse's capacity for that product.

**Delivery Time Constraint:** The total shipment of each product type from all warehouses to a customer should meet or exceed the customer's demand.

# Usage:
The code uses Pyomo, a Python-based optimization modeling language, and SCIP, a solver library, to solve the transportation and logistics optimization problem. The model is designed to handle multiple product types, warehouse capacities, and customer demand requirements.

# Results:
Upon successful optimization, the code presents the optimal transportation plan, indicating the quantity of each product to be shipped from each warehouse to each customer. Additionally, it displays the total transportation cost, providing valuable insights for the retailer's logistics decision-making process.
